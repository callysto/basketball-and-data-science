    "This series of notebooks is designed to introduce you to the foundational concepts and techniques used in data science, with a focus on basketball data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our world becomes increasingly data-driven, the ability to analyze, visualize, and draw insights from large and complex datasets is becoming an essential skill. Data science can provide you with the tools to make better decisions and solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Python](https://www.python.org/) as our programming language in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) since that is how data science is usually done in the real world. We also use Python because it has great [code libraries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/libraries-in-python/) for data science, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).\n",
