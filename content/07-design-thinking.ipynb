    "Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that helps us come up with creative solutions. It is a flexible process, but the general steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Empathize: Try to understand the problem from different perspectives.\n",
    "1. Define: Define the problem as clearly as possible, so that you have a specific goal to work towards.\n",
    "1. Ideate: Brainstorm ideas for solutions.\n",
    "1. Prototype: Create prototypes, which are like rough drafts or models of your solutions.\n",
    "1. Test: Try out your prototypes and get feedback.\n",
    "1. Iterate: Refine and make changes based on tests and feedback.\n",
    "1. Implement: If there is a prototype that works well, explore ways to implement or share it.\n",
    "1. Evaluate: Evaluate the effectiveness of your finished solution, and reflect on your process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work on your data science project, keep these steps in mind."
